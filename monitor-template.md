## Use

What the monitor is used for -- which metrics and for what -- discussion


## Metrics
Besides the common default metrics that are described [here](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitor-config.html), the following table shows additional optional metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Default are standard metrics that are monitored by default. You may need to add a flag to these metrics. Check the config file for flag requirements. 

Name	Type	Default	Description
cpu.utilization	gauge	âœ”	Percentage of total CPU used within the last metric interval cycle.

### Optional metrics

To collect optional metrics, you must configure your monitor to listen for those metrics and then send those metrics to the agent.

To specify optional metrics, add a metricsToInclude filter to the agent configuration file, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet lists all available optional metrics. Copy and paste the snippet into your monitor configuration file, then delete any optional metrics that you do not want.

Note that some of the optional metrics require you to set a flag in addition to adding them to the metricsToInclude list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is required for gathering optional metrics.

```
sh
metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - name
    - name
    monitorType: <name>
```

## Dimensions
The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor. Some dimensions may be specific to certain metrics; other dimensions can be configured. You can add extra dimensions to most metrics. The Common configuration options page [here](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitor-config.html) also describes how to configure for these extra dimensions. 

Name	Description
plugin_instance	Set to whatever you set in the name config option.
