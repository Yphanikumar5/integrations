title: cpu.system
brief: CPU time spent running in the kernel -- This value reflects how often processes are calling into the kernel for services (e.g to log to the console). In order to get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this metric may be caused by: 1) A process that needs to be re-written to use kernel resources more efficiently, or 2) A userspace driver that is broken
