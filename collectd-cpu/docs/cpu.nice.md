title: cpu.nice
brief: CPU time spent in userspace running 'nice'-ed processes. In order to get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this metric may be caused by: 1) The server not having enough CPU capacity for a process, 2) A programming error which causes a process to use an unexpected amount of CPU
