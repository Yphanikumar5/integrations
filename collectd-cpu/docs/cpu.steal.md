title: cpu.steal
brief: CPU time spent waiting for a hypervisor to service requests from other virtual machines -- This metric is only present on virtual machines. This metric records how much time this virtual machine had to wait to have the hypervisor kernel service a request. In order to get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this metric may be caused by: 1) Another VM on the same hypervisor using too many resources, or 2) An underpowered hypervisor
